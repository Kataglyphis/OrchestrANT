## About The Project

This project is a starting point for my Python AI workloads.  
Use it as a starting point for creating and deploying your own Python projects.

### Key Features

- Features are to be adjusted to your own project needs.

## Overview

The versioning of the package can be viewed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Getting Started

### Setup

Feel free to adjust for your own environment.
F.e. create a virtual venv with a specific python version.

```bash
uv venv
python3.11 -m venv .venv
```

### Pre commit hook
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # .venv/Scripts/activate on pwsh
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# run on all files once (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Dependency updates

Dependency upgrades go through Renovate, run as a local CLI — not by hand. The
Renovate GitHub App is installed on no repo in this family, so this wrapper is
the only thing that ever reads the tracked `.github/renovate.json`; no workflow
runs it and it blocks no commit.

```bash
bash scripts/linux/renovate-local.sh                   # what is behind (report)
bash scripts/linux/renovate-local.sh --managers pep621 # the pyproject.toml pins
bash scripts/linux/renovate-local.sh --apply --dry-run # the gitlink plan
```

The report only reads, and runs from any directory. On this Windows host run it
from WSL: there is no node on the Windows side. `--apply` is the half that writes,
and it writes gitlinks only, for submodules that declare a branch (here just
`third_party/ANTfrastructure`). It needs the git that wrote the working tree, and
the script settles that itself: from WSL it switches to `git.exe`, and refuses
up front when it cannot reach one. The pip side is report-only, and reports
nothing about the transitive pins in `uv.lock`.

Full rationale:
[dependency-updates.md](third_party/ANTfrastructure/docs/dependency-updates.md).

### Installation

There are three major ways to install this package in your environment:

1. **Install directly via pip:**
   ```bash
   pip install OrchestrANT@git+https://github.com/Kataglyphis/OrchestrANT
   ```
   or install a specific tagged version:
   ```bash
   pip install OrchestrANT@git+https://github.com/Kataglyphis/OrchestrANT@v0.0.1
   ```

2. **Install after cloning the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Kataglyphis/OrchestrANT
   pip install .
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   (an editable install: changes in the repo will be reflected in your environment)

3. **Add as a submodule to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/Kataglyphis/OrchestrANT
   ```
   Make sure that all dependencies are installed during your repo’s installation.  
   (Not generally recommended, as it can be more complicated.)

#### Picamera web browser live stream

You need to shared system packages for the 
`picamera2` should be installed via `apt`
([source](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2))

```bash
sudo apt install python3-picamera2
uv venv --system-site-packages
```

### Deployment Recommendations (Hardware/Software)

#### Python package deployment in pure C

For insights into deploying Python packages into production as “binary only” wheels
have a look into the corresponding workflows.  

After creating the wheel you can check content with the command:
```bash
# Unzip a .whl
python -m zipfile --extract <ZIP_DATEI> <ZIEL_ORDNER>
```

This will print all available compatible tags for deployment

```bash
pip debug --verbose
```

```bash
./scripts/linux/ci_static_analysis.sh > "ci_analysis_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log" 2>&1
```

This is the same gate CI runs, and it is a **gate**: it exits `1` if codespell,
bandit, vulture, `ruff check --no-fix`, `ruff format --check` or `ty check`
reports anything. Redirecting both streams into a log as above hides that from
the terminal — check `$?`, or drop the redirect.

**__NOTE:__** If you want to install your package editable and you previously deployed  
it you will need to delete all Cython generated files first. You can use the following  
command for it:  
```bash  
find . -type f \( -name '\*.c' -o -name '\*.cpp' -o -name '\*.so' -o -name '\*.pyd' -o -name '\*.html' \) -delete  
```

Or on windows ... do this  
```powershell  
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -File | Where-Object { $\_.Extension -in '.c', '.cpp', '.so', '.pyd', '.html' } | Remove-Item  
```

## Tests

For development, you can install comprehensive dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -v -e .[dev,docs,test]
```
Then run your testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
