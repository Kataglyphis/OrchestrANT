# No html_css_files. This used to load "ANTfrastructureStatic/css/custom.css"
# through a symlink into ANTfrastructure's docs/_static. That directory no longer
# exists there - the shared Sphinx theme moved out to DocumANTation
# and is consumed as the pip package `sphinx_kataglyphis` - so the symlink was
# dangling and the stylesheet had silently not been applied for some time.
# Removed together with the two dead symlinks (2026-08-11).
#
# To adopt the shared theme here, install `sphinx-kataglyphis-theme` and use
# `from sphinx_kataglyphis import setup_theme`, the way ANTfrastructure's own
# docs/conf.py does. That is a deliberate theme change rather than a cleanup:
# this project currently renders with sphinx_book_theme, set above.
